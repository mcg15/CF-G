  <h2>Here are some herbs you can grow at home!</h2>
  <p> Growing herbs at home isn't that hard. Besides having fresh herbs at hand
    whenever you need, you will also reduce the amount of plastic packaging you
    would use by constantly buying herbs, and lower  your carbon footprint!
    Scroll over each section to find out more about each herb.</p>

    <h3>Basil</h3>
      <!-- <p class='emojis'> ☀️☀️☀️ 💧💧💧 </p> -->

      <p class='info'> ☀️☀️☀️ 💧💧💧 <br> Basil likes lots of sunlight and water. Keep on a sunny windowsill
        where the plant can get around 6 hours of sunlight and water your
        basil plant everyday. Basil is delicious in pesto or as a garnish on pasta - just clip off
        the leaves as and when you need! </p>

      <h3> Parsley</h3>
      <!-- <p class='emojis'>  ☀️☀️☀️  💧💧 </p> -->
        <p class='info'> ☀️☀️☀️  💧💧 <br>Parsely also likes lots of sunlight - around 6-8 hours per day. You
        don't have to water parsely every day but make sure the soil stays damp
      to the touch. Parsely goes great in sauce to accompany fish.</p>

      <h3> Rosemary</h3>
      <!-- <p class='emojis'> ☀️ 💧 </p> -->
        <p class='info'> ☀️ 💧 <br> Rosemary prefers drier soil so you don't need to water it as much.
          Rosemary is a low-maintenance kind of gal and doesn't need too much
          sun either, prefering a bright but cool spot. Rosemary is delicious
          with lamb.</p>

      <h3> Thyme </h3>
      <!-- <p class='emojis'> ☀️☀️ 💧 </p> -->
        <p class='info'> ☀️☀️ 💧 <br> Thyme is super hard and doesn't need much watering at all. Water thyme -
          well whenever you have time! Let the soild become slightly dry between
          waterings. Thyme also likes lots of sun, but doesn't need direct sunny
          so can be grown anywhere as long as its bright. Thyme and honey on
          baked camembert is second to none. </p>
